Developed techniques for indexing and querying spatial data using the Sort-Tile-Recursive (STR) algorithm to build R-trees in memory. Implemented incremental nearest neighbor search using best-first strategies, calculating the k nearest neighbors for given coordinates. Focused on efficient spatial data handling, including constructing data structures and performing distance-based queries.
